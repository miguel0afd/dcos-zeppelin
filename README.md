# zeppelin-docker

This is the docker build for Zeppelin on DCOS.

## Building

```sh
cd docker
docker build -t mesosphere/zeppelin:<version> .
```

## Installing

These are instructions for installing and accessing the DCOS Zeppelin
package.  We'll probably move these to user docs at some point.

The following are instructions for installing Zeppelin on an AWS DCOS
cluster such that you can access it from the public internet using
marathon-lb as a proxy.  An alternative is to launch Zeppelin directly
on a a public slave.

1. Install marathon-lb

   ```sh
   dcos package install marathon-lb
   ```

2. Install zeppelin

   ```sh
   dcos package install zeppelin --options=zeppelin.json
   ```

   zeppelin.json:
   ```json
   {
       "zeppelin": {
           "vhost": "zeppelin.your-url.com"
       }
   }
   ```

3. Configure ELB

   You must modify your ELB in two ways.

   The first is to update the health check so that marathon-lb will show
   up as a backend to the ELB.  Add "HTTP:9090/_haproxy_health_check".

   The second is to change the `HTTP:80` listener to be `TCP:80`.  This is to
   support Zeppelin websockets.

4.  Create a DNS entry for zeppelin.your-url.com

    Create a CNAME entry that maps the `vhost` parameter above to the ELB
    DNS entry.  In development, you can simply add an entry to your
    `/etc/hosts` file.

You should now be able to visit zeppelin.your-url.com to view Zeppelin.
